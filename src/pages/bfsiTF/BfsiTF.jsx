              Blockchain Integration for Trade Finance: An Overview
The domain of trade finance, which relies on financial institutions to provide credit facilities for ensuring the exchange of goods, has clung to a traditional process that has seen minimal evolution despite the expansion of global trade dynamics.

Compounded by intricate procedures and diverse regulations across geographical boundaries, the existing trade finance framework faces multifaceted challenges. The presence of numerous external parties spanning jurisdictions complicates international trade, resulting in a cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming process.

These challenges underscore the compelling case for integrating blockchain technology into trade finance.
