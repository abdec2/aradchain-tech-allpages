              Understanding Music NFTs and Their Mechanism

Non-fungible tokens have gained significant popularity due to their characteristics such as immutability, public verification, and the ability to establish scarcity. These features enable musicians and creators to distribute their music and digital content to fans without the risk of counterfeits.
