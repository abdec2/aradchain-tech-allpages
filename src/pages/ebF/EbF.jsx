    <strong>Distributed Ledger Architecture</strong><br/>
    Distributed ledgers offer transparency and traceability of transactions, enhancing visibility into tracking processes and automating operations through smart contracts. Networks remain resilient to downtime and manipulation risks.
</Text>

<Text align={'center'} letterSpacing={1}>
