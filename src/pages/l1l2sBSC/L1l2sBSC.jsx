Key Features of Binance Smart Chain
Binance Smart Chain incorporates the following features that can strengthen and accelerate your business operations.

Proof of Staked Authority
Binance Smart Chain employs an innovative Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) algorithm, where validators stake BNB to secure the network. This enhances transaction capacity and speeds up block times.

Cross-Chain Compatibility
The dual-chain architecture of Binance Smart Chain facilitates seamless asset transfers between different blockchains, allowing swift trading on the Binance Chain and effortless dApp development.

EVM Compatibility
Being EVM-compatible, Binance Smart Chain supports Ethereum tools and dApps. Smart contracts written for Ethereum's EVM can be effortlessly migrated to Binance Smart Chain.

BEP-20
BEP-20 serves as a token standard on Binance Smart Chain, extending ERC-20. It acts as a blueprint for tokens, enabling transactions on BSC. A BEP-20 token can represent anything from business shares to currency.

Unlock the Potential of our BSC Solutions Development
AradChain Technologies provides comprehensive Binance Smart Chain solutions, driven by the unique operational mechanism of this blockchain technology. This approach rests on the following two pillars:
