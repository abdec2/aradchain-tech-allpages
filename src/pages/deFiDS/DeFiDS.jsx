Revolutionizing the Conventional Lending and Borrowing Paradigm with DeFi Staking
DeFi staking involves users holding or locking their funds to participate in maintaining proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain systems. It operates similarly to cryptocurrency mining, contributing to network consensus while incentivizing user engagement.

DeFi staking reshapes and streamlines traditional lending and borrowing processes, introducing crucial transparency into the mix. This compelling advantage has led to global adoption and recognition of DeFi staking. The total assets staked within DeFi platforms reached $21 to $23 billion in January 2021, underscoring the burgeoning demand for staking.

Should you be considering entering the billion-dollar staking market by launching your own DeFi staking software, AradChain Technologies Solutions stands ready to guide and expedite your journey.

Staking-as-a-Service Platform
Distinct from exchanges and wallets that serve trading and storage roles, staking-as-a-service platforms exclusively focus on staking. This approach, known as soft staking, offers specialized staking services.

TALK TO OUR EXPERTS
Rewarding User Participation
As a DeFi staking platform owner, you can select from various mechanisms to reward users who stake their assets on your platform.
validate_img-min
Validate
Users are incentivized to validate the blockchain. Validation tasks are proportionate to users' staked assets, rewarding those with higher stakes with more validation tasks and greater rewards.
claim_img-min
Claim
Users are rewarded for locking their assets on your platform for a predetermined period. The reward calculation is based on locked assets – greater locked-in assets translate to higher rewards directly transferred to users' wallets.
delegate_img-min
Delegate
Involves participation from a fund manager who handles substantial capital. Profits generated are reinvested, with dividends equally distributed among users. The fund manager receives a fee for services rendered and expertise provided.
